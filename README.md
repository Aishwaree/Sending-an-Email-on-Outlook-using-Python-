# Sending-an-Email-on-Outlook-using-Python
I used Python to send an email on Outlook! Copy the script from my gist here [https://gist.github.com/Aishwaree/fbe6a947c3b82591f5f38931cdfc0689]
I sent an email with a attachment and a signature. I was able to add a signature by adding the HTML code of my signature copied from the console on my web browser. See the files for pictures of this!
