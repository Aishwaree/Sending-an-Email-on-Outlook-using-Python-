# Sending-an-Email-on-Outlook-using-Python
Here is an example of me using Python to send an email on Outlook!
The email contains an attachment and a signature. I was able to add a signature by adding the HTML code of my signature copied from the console on my web browser.
Copy the script from my gist here [https://gist.github.com/Aishwaree/fbe6a947c3b82591f5f38931cdfc0689]
